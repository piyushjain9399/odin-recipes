# odin-recipes
1st project while following the WebD course on The Odin Project. In this project, we would build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

In the completion of this project the key learnings I acquired were,
 - Setting up a html webpage and linking webpages to each other.
 - Setting up Github and using Git commands like git status, git add, git commit and git push
 - Adding images and links to the webpages.
 - Using ordered and unordered lists.
